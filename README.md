## Introduction

Welcome to React Saga Todos Tracker! Elevate your React application with the power of React Saga, a sophisticated middleware that seamlessly integrates with Redux, bringing asynchronous capabilities to the forefront. Manage your todos effortlessly with real-time updates, thanks to the magic of React Saga.

## Key Features

Unleash the full potential of React Saga Todos Tracker with these key features:

1. **Middleware Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Redux middleware, enabling non-blocking handling of side effects.

2. **Generator Functions**: Express asynchronous flows with ease using generator functions for managing complex logic.

3. **Declarative Effects**: Define side effects declaratively using Saga effects, making asynchronous logic readable and maintainable.

4. **Watcher and Worker Sagas**: Organize sagas into watcher sagas for listening to actions and worker sagas for performing asynchronous tasks.

5. **Non-Blocking Calls**: Enable non-blocking calls, allowing your application to remain responsive while waiting for asynchronous operations.

6. **Cancellation and Forking**: Exercise fine-grained control with support for task cancellation and forking, enhancing execution management.

7. **Centralized Side Effect Logic**: Centralize side effect logic for easy management and testing of asynchronous behavior in a React-Redux application.

8. **Error Handling**: Facilitate error handling with try-catch blocks, making it straightforward to handle and recover from asynchronous errors.

9. **Inter-Saga Communication**: Enable sagas to communicate and coordinate complex asynchronous workflows for efficient task execution.

10. **Integration with Redux**: Seamlessly integrate with Redux, enhancing state management capabilities with a powerful solution for handling asynchronous logic.

## Technology Stack
